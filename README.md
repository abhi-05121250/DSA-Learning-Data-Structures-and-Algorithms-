Welcome to the DSA (Learning Data Structures and Algorithms) repository! 

🚀 How Starting DSA Transformed My Job Search! 📈
When I graduated from college and joined a product-based startup, I worked with Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). But honestly, I never went deep into graphs and all that jazz. 😅

Fast forward to my recent job hunt: rejection emails were piling up like spam! 📬 It hit me hard: "Opportunities are given to those who are deserving." 🌟
Did you know that 78% of tech hiring managers consider strong DSA skills essential for software development roles? 📊 This statistic was my wake-up call.

Determined to turn things around, I dove into countless articles, Medium blogs, and LinkedIn posts.
The unanimous advice? "Do DSA, DSA, and more DSA." 📚

So, I buckled down, started spending time on DSA, and polished my resume. And guess what? Within two to three weeks of consistent practice, I got calls from TWO major organizations! 🎉 (Keeping names secret for now—don’t want to jinx it! 😉)

Attached are images of a sneak peek at my current DSA study strategy (excuse my handwriting 📝):
